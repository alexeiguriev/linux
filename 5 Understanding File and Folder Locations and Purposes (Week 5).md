5 Understanding File and Folder Locations and Purposes (Week 5)

* Objective: Learn the purpose of key files and directories in the Linux file system.

Topics to Cover:

* Common directories and their purposes:
    * /bin, /usr/bin: Essential binaries → esential commands (ls, cp, mv, rm, cat, etc.)
    * boot - Contains boot loader files (like GRUB) and the Linux kernel itself.
    * /etc: Configuration files
    * /lib and /lib64 shared libraries and kernel modules needed by the system to function correctly
    * /media: Mount points for removable media (USB drives, CDs).
    * /opt: - third-party applications.
    * /root: Home directory for the root (administrator) user.
    * /sbin: System binaries for administrative tasks (for the superuser).
    * /snap -?
    * /sys: Virtual file system with system hardware information.
    * /usr: User programs, libraries, and documentation.
    * /bin.usr-is-merged - ?
    * /dev: Device files
    * /home: User home directories
    * /lib.usr-is-merged - ?
    * /lost+found - ?
    * /mnt: Temporary mount points for file systems.
    * /proc: Virtual file system containing system and process information.
    * /run: Data for running system processes (runtime files like PID files).
    * sbin.usr-is-merged -?
    * /srv: Data for services like web servers and FTP.
    * /tmp: Temporary files (often cleared on reboot).
    * /var: Variable data like logs, databases, and email spools.
    * /local: Local-specific data and programs (often empty by default, used for custom software installs).
    * /lost+found: Recovered files after disk checks, used by the file system for orphaned files.
* Configuring environment variables (.bashrc, .bash_profile, /etc/environment)
* Understanding system logs: journalctl, /var/log/

Practice:

* Explore the structure of /etc, /home, and /var to understand their purposes.
* Configure a sample environment variable in .bashrc or /etc/environment.
* Use journalctl to analyze system logs.



In Linux, the file system is structured into a hierarchy, where everything is organized under the root directory /. This structure consists of various directories, each serving a specific purpose. Understanding the purpose of each directory is crucial for system administration, file organization, and effective navigation.
Here’s an overview of important file and folder locations and their purposes in a typical Linux system:

1. Root Directory (/)

* The root directory is the top-most directory in the Linux file system hierarchy.
* All other directories, files, and devices are mounted or located under this root directory.

2. /bin (Binaries)

* Contains essential binary executables needed for the system to operate in single-user mode.
* Includes basic commands like ls, cp, mv, rm, cat, etc.
* These binaries are available to all users and are required for basic system functionality.

3. /sbin (System Binaries)

* Contains essential system binaries for administrative tasks, typically executable only by the root user.
* Commands like ifconfig, reboot, fdisk, and fsck are located here.
* These are critical for system maintenance and management.

4. /usr (User Binaries and Data)

* The /usr directory holds user-installed programs and libraries that are not required for basic system functionality but are commonly used by users.
* /usr/bin: Non-essential user binaries (e.g., applications like vim, git).
* /usr/sbin: Non-essential system binaries (e.g., apache2, sshd).
* /usr/lib: Shared libraries for programs in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin.
* /usr/local: For programs installed manually by the user or administrator. It's a common location for custom software.

5. /boot (Boot Loader Files)

* Contains boot loader files (like GRUB) and the Linux kernel itself.
* This is where the system starts the booting process.
* Files like vmlinuz (kernel) and initrd.img are found here.
* Care should be taken when modifying or deleting files from this directory.

6. /etc (Configuration Files)

* Contains system-wide configuration files for programs and services.
* Configuration files like fstab, hosts, and passwd reside here.
* This directory is often edited to change system settings (e.g., networking, users, or services).
* Subdirectories in /etc contain specific configurations, such as /etc/ssh/ for SSH settings or /etc/network/ for network configurations.

7. /var (Variable Files)

* Contains variable data that changes frequently during system operation.
* /var/log: Log files of system and application activity (e.g., /var/log/syslog, /var/log/auth.log).
* /var/spool: Contains spool files for tasks like printing and mail.
* /var/lib: Persistent application data for services (e.g., databases, package management systems like apt).

8. /home (User Home Directories)

* Contains home directories for regular users.
* Each user has their own subdirectory (e.g., /home/username), where personal files, configuration files, and documents are stored.
* Users have full control over their home directories.

9. /root (Root User's Home Directory)

* This is the home directory of the root user (administrator).
* Unlike /home, which holds regular users’ home directories, /root is reserved for the superuser.
* Root’s home directory is separate for security and privacy reasons.

10. /dev (Device Files)

* Contains device files that represent hardware components like disks, terminals, and printers.
* These are special files used to interact with devices through the file system.
* Examples: /dev/sda (first hard drive), /dev/tty1 (terminal), /dev/null (data sink).

11. /mnt and /media (Mount Points)

* /mnt: Temporary mount point for system administrators to mount file systems manually.
* /media: Automatically used for removable media such as USB drives and CDs. When a device is inserted, it’s typically mounted here (e.g., /media/usb).

12. /proc (Process Information)

* This virtual filesystem contains information about running processes.
* It dynamically generates information in real-time (like memory usage, CPU info, and system stats).
* For example, /proc/cpuinfo contains details about the CPU, and /proc/meminfo contains details about memory usage.

13. /tmp (Temporary Files)

* Stores temporary files created by system processes and applications.
* Files in /tmp are typically deleted on system reboot.
* Applications may store temporary data here during runtime.

14. /lib and /lib64 (Shared Libraries)

* Contains shared libraries used by programs in /bin and /sbin.
* /lib is for 32-bit libraries, and /lib64 is for 64-bit libraries.
* These libraries are essential for system functionality (similar to DLLs in Windows).

15. /opt (Optional Software)

* Stores optional third-party software and add-on packages.
* It's a good place to install programs that aren’t provided by the package manager.
* Software in /opt is usually not essential to system functioning but is often used by users.

16. /sys (System Information)

* This is another virtual filesystem like /proc, containing information about devices, kernel modules, and hardware.
* /sys is primarily used by the kernel to interact with and expose information about the hardware to the user space.

17. /run (Runtime Variable Data)

* Stores runtime data since the last boot.
* It's typically used for process and service information, like PID files, socket files, and other temporary system information.

18. /srv (Service Data)

* Contains data for services provided by the system, like web servers or FTP servers.
* For example, /srv/http might contain files for a web server's root directory.


Key Takeaways:

* Everything is a file: Devices, processes, and hardware are accessed as files in Linux.
* Organized structure: Each directory has a specific role, and data is categorized based on its purpose (binaries, libraries, logs, configuration, user data, etc.).
* Root directory (/) is the starting point: All files and directories are under the root (/).

Understanding the purpose of these directories helps with system navigation, troubleshooting, configuration, and managing software effectively on Linux.
